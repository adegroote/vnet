vNet is a virtual network system which lets the system route / drop / delay the
message, at a high level (in the ISO stack).

In a first step, we plan to implement it to deal with :
	- a protocol on top of YARP [1]
	- using a world representation using Morse [2].

It will be extendable in the two directions, dealing with different protocols,
and using world representation from different source. It will be configurable
to select defined policies, or new alea for routing too.
